## spelling
spelling uses velthuis romanization. For more info see [wikipedia: velthuis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velthuis)

additionally, to try it yourself, try [aksharamukha](https://www.aksharamukha.com/converter) to convert to and from velthuis romanization

(aksharamukha doesn't allow using /, so replace it with ~m when testing)
